        <p>A <strong>Script</strong> is program code that doesnâ€™t need pre-processing (e.g. compiling) before being run.
        <br>In the context of a Web browser,
        scripting usually refers to program code written in JavaScript that is executed
        by the browser when a page is downloaded,or in response to an event triggered by the user.</br></p>
        <p><strong>Scripting</strong> can make Web pages more dynamic.
           <br>For example,without reloading a new version of a page it may allow modifications to the content of that page,
        or allow content to be added to or sent from that page. The former has been called DHTML (Dynamic HTML), and the latter AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML).</br>
